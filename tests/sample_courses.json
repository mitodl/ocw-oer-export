Examples and applications are drawn from nuclear and other industries, waste repositories, and mechanical systems.\n",

Topics include basic probability rules; random variables and distribution functions; functions of random variables; and applications to quality control and the reliability assessment of mechanical/electrical components, as well as simple structures and redundant systems. The course also considers elements of statistics; Bayesian methods in engineering; methods for reliability and risk assessment of complex systems (event-tree and fault-tree analysis, common-cause failures, human reliability models); uncertainty propagation in complex systems (Monte Carlo methods, Latin Hypercube Sampling); and an introduction to Markov models. Examples and applications are drawn from nuclear and other industries, waste repositories, and mechanical systems.\n",

What are major strategic constraints and issues confronted by entrepreneurs today?\n2.  How can one identify and evaluate marketing opportunities?\n3.  How do entrepreneurs achieve competitive advantages given limited marketing resources?\n4.  What major marketing/sales tools are most useful in an entrepreneurial setting?\n\nBecause there is no universal marketing solution applicable to all entrepreneurial ventures, this course is designed to help students develop a flexible way of thinking about marketing problems in general.\n",

At this course, there are two major questions:\n\n1.  **Marketing Question:** What and how am I selling to whom?\n2.  **New Venture Question:** How do I best leverage my limited marketing recourses?\n\nSpecifically, this course is designed to give students a broad and deep understanding of such topics as:\n\n1.  What are major strategic constraints and issues confronted by entrepreneurs today?\n2.  How can one identify and evaluate marketing opportunities?\n3.  How do entrepreneurs achieve competitive advantages given limited marketing resources?\n4.  What major marketing/sales tools are most useful in an entrepreneurial setting?\n\nBecause there is no universal marketing solution applicable to all entrepreneurial ventures, this course is designed to help students develop a flexible way of thinking about marketing problems in general.\n",
