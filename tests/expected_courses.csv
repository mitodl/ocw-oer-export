Hands-On Introduction to Electrical Engineering Lab Skills,https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-091-hands-on-introduction-to-electrical-engineering-lab-skills-january-iap-2008,Full Course,Text/HTML,null,"This course introduces students to both passive and active electronic components (op-amps, 555 timers, TTL digital circuits). Basic analog and digital circuits and theory of operation are covered. The labs allow the students to master the use of electronic instruments and construct and/or solder several circuits. The labs also reinforce the concepts discussed in class with a hands-on approach and allow the students to gain significant experience with electrical instruments such as function generators, digital multimeters, oscilloscopes, logic analyzers and power supplies. In the last lab, the students build an electronic circuit that they can keep. The course is geared to freshmen and others who want an introduction to electronics circuits.

Marketing Question: What and how am I selling to whom?
New Venture Question: How do I best leverage my limited marketing recourses?

Specifically, this course is designed to give students a broad and deep understanding of such topics as:

What are major strategic constraints and issues confronted by entrepreneurs today?
How can one identify and evaluate marketing opportunities?
How do entrepreneurs achieve competitive advantages given limited marketing resources?
What major marketing/sales tools are most useful in an entrepreneurial setting?

Because there is no universal marketing solution applicable to all entrepreneurial ventures, this course is designed to help students develop a flexible way of thinking about marketing problems in general.",en,Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial Share Alike 4.0,student|teacher,Business and Communication|Marketing,Entrepreneurship|Marketing|Strategy|Pricing|Distribution|Customer Relationship|Preference|Venture,"Kim, Jin",MIT,MIT OpenCourseWare,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/,MIT,Curriculum/Instruction|Assessment,Visual|Textual
