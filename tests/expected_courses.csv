Modern Conceptions of Freedom,https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/cc-111-modern-conceptions-of-freedom-spring-2013,Full Course,Text/HTML,College/Upper Division|Community College/Lower Division,"This course examines the modern definition of freedom, and the obligations that people accept in honoring it. It investigates how these obligations are captured in the principles of our political associations. This course also studies how the centrality of freedom plays out in the political thought of such authors as Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Burke and Montesquieu, as well as debating which notions of freedom inspire and sustain the American experiment by careful reading of the documents and arguments of the founding of the United States.

American Consumer Culture,https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/21h-206-american-consumer-culture-fall-2007,Full Course,Text/HTML,College/Upper Division|Community College/Lower Division,"This class examines how and why twentieth-century Americans came to define the ""good life"" through consumption, leisure, and material abundance. We will explore how such things as department stores, nationally advertised brand-name goods, mass-produced cars, and suburbs transformed the American economy, society, and politics. The course is organized both thematically and chronologically. Each period deals with a new development in the history of consumer culture. Throughout we explore both celebrations and critiques of mass consumption and abundance.",en,Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial Share Alike 4.0,student|teacher,Anthropology|Arts and Humanities|History|Philosophy|Social Science|U.S. History,Twentieth Century History|History|Popular Culture|United States|Marketing|Mass-Production|Consumption|Economics|Politics|Middle Class|Advertising|Status|American Dream|Mass-Market|Suburbs|E-Commerce|Fast Food,2007-09-01,"Jacobs, Meg",MIT,MIT OpenCourseWare,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/,"Jacobs, Meg",Curriculum/Instruction|Assessment,Visual|Textual

Immensely diverse in structure and function, NPs have strongly influenced how we treat infectious disease, cancer, pain, and a host of other conditions. Roughly half of the drugs that have been approved in the past 30 years are NPs, derivatives of NPs or NP-inspired. In this discussion-based course, we will delve into research on discovering NPs from producing organisms, investigating the biochemistry of NP production, and using synthetic biology to create NP derivatives—all with a particular emphasis on how genomic data guides and informs all these studies.
This course is one of many Advanced Undergraduate Seminars offered by the Biology Department at MIT. These seminars are tailored for students with an interest in using primary research literature to discuss and learn about current biological research in a highly interactive setting.

Several questions shape the syllabus and provide a framework for approaching the course materials: How do familiar aspects of comics trace their origins to literary texts and broader cultural concerns? How have classic comics gone on to influence literary fiction? In what ways do contemporary graphic narratives bring a new kind of seriousness of purpose to comics, blurring what's left of the boundaries between the highbrow and the lowbrow? Readings and materials for the course range from the nineteenth century to the present, and include novels, short stories, essays, older and newer comics, and some older and newer films. Expectations include diligent reading, active participation, occasional discussion leading, and two papers.",en,Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial Share Alike 4.0,student|teacher,Arts and Humanities|Literature|Reading Literature,Popular Culture and Narrative|Literature|Comics|Culture|Literary Fiction|Contemporary|Graphic Narratives|Broader Cultural Concerns|Contemporary Graphic Narratives.,2010-09-01,"Picker, John",MIT,MIT OpenCourseWare,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/,"Picker, John",Curriculum/Instruction|Assessment,Visual|Textual
