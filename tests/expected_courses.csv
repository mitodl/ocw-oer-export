Urban Design,https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/11-332j-urban-design-fall-2003,Full Course,Text/HTML,Graduate/Professional,"For many years, Cambridge, MA, as host to two major research universities, has been the scene of debates as to how best to meet the competing expectations of different stakeholders. Where there has been success, it has frequently been the result, at least in part, of inventive urban design proposals and the design and implementation of new institutional arrangements to accomplish those proposals. Where there has been failure it has often been explained by the inability - or unwillingness - of one stakeholder to accept and accommodate the expectations of another. The two most recent fall Urban Design Studios have examined these issues at a larger scale. In 2001 we looked at the possible patterns for growth and change in Cambridge, UK, as triggered by the plans of Cambridge University. And in 2002 we looked at these same issues along the length of the MIT 'frontier' in Cambridge, MA as they related to the development of MIT and the biotech research industry.
In the fall 2003 Urban Design Studio we propose to focus in on an area adjacent to Cambridgeport and the western end of the MIT campus, roughly centered on Fort Washington. Our goal is to discover the ways in which good urban form, an apt mix of activities, and effective institutional mechanisms might all be brought together in ways that respect shared expectations and reconcile competing expectations - perhaps in unexpected and adroit ways.",en,Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial Share Alike 4.0,student|teacher,Architecture and Design|Arts and Humanities|Social Science,Urban Planning|Community|Stakeholders|Development|Urban Growth|MIT|Cambridge|Cambridgeport|Institutional Mechanisms|Housing|Universities|Town and Gown|Built Form|Public Space|Landscape|Path and Access Systems|Parking|Density|Activity Location and Intensity|Planning|Finance|Public/Private Partnerships|Parcelization|Phasing|Multi-Disciplinary Teams,2003-08-01,"Burns, Carol|de Monchaux, John",MIT,MIT OpenCourseWare,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/,MIT,Curriculum/Instruction|Assessment,Visual|Textual

Network Optimization,https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/15-082j-network-optimization-fall-2010,Full Course,Text/HTML,Graduate/Professional,"15.082J/6.855J/ESD.78J is a graduate subject in the theory and practice of network flows and its extensions. Network flow problems form a subclass of linear programming problems with applications to transportation, logistics, manufacturing, computer science, project management, and finance, as well as a number of other domains. This subject will survey some of the applications of network flows and focus on key special cases of network flow problems including the following: the shortest path problem, the maximum flow problem, the minimum cost flow problem, and the multi-commodity flow problem. We will also consider other extensions of network flow problems.",en,Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial Share Alike 4.0,student|teacher,Business and Communication|Computer Science|Engineering|Mathematics,Network Models|Network Design|Maximum Flow Algorithm|Minimum Cost Flow|Shortest Path Algorithm|Algorithm Efficiency|Preflow Push Algorithm|Data Structures,2010-08-01,"Orlin, James",MIT,MIT OpenCourseWare,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/,MIT,Curriculum/Instruction,Visual|Textual
"Electrical, Optical, and Magnetic Properties of Materials",https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/3-23-electrical-optical-and-magnetic-properties-of-materials-fall-2007,Full Course,Text/HTML,Graduate/Professional,"This class discusses the origin of electrical, magnetic and optical properties of materials, with a focus on the acquisition of quantum mechanical tools. It begins with an analysis of the properties of materials, presentation of the postulates of quantum mechanics, and close examination of the hydrogen atom, simple molecules and bonds, and the behavior of electrons in solids and energy bands. Introducing the variation principle as a method for the calculation of wavefunctions, the course continues with investigation of how and why materials respond to different electrical, magnetic and electromagnetic fields and probes and study of the conductivity, dielectric function, and magnetic permeability in metals, semiconductors, and insulators. A survey of common devices such as transistors, magnetic storage media, optical fibers concludes the semester.

Major Authors: John Milton,https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/21l-705-major-authors-john-milton-spring-2008,Full Course,Text/HTML,College/Upper Division|Community College/Lower Division,"In 1667, John Milton published what he intended both as the crowning achievement of a poetic career and a justification of God's ways to man: an epic poem which retold and reimagined the Biblical story of creation, temptation, and original sin. Even in a hostile political climate, Paradise Lost was almost immediately recognized as a classic, and one fate of a classic is to be rewritten, both by admirers and by antagonists. In this seminar, we will read Paradise Lost alongside works of 20th century fantasy and science fiction which rethink both Milton's text and its source.
Students should come to the seminar having read Paradise Lost straight through at least once; this can be accomplished by taking the IAP subject, Reading Paradise Lost (21L.995), or independently. Twentieth century authors will include C. S. Lewis (Perelandra, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe) and Philip Pullman (His Dark Materials), as well as assorted criticism. Each week, one class meeting will focus on Milton, and the other on one of the modern novels.",en,Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial Share Alike 4.0,student|teacher,Arts and Humanities|Literature|Reading Literature,John Milton|Paradise Lost|Renaissance Literature|Medieval Literature|Poetry|Epic Poetry|Religious Poetry|Literary Criticism|Literary Analysis|Philip Pullman|The Golden Compass|His Dark Materials|William Blake|Biblical Analysis|Bible|Genesis|Seminar Course|Discussion,2008-02-01,"Fuller, Mary",MIT,MIT OpenCourseWare,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/,MIT,Curriculum/Instruction|Assessment,Visual|Textual
